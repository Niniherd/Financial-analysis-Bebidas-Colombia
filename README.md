### Conclutions
The company efficiently utilizes its assets to generate profits, with solid cost control reflected in a stable and competitive gross margin. Shareholders have enjoyed growing returns throughout the analyzed period; however, in 2022, liquidity issues arose, reducing the availability of cash.

Regarding debt, management has been appropriate, although financing has been allocated not only to fixed assets but also to working capital. This highlights the need to strengthen debt management to ensure that leverage remains sustainable and continues to create long-term value.
